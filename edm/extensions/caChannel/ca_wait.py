# Test the simple CA methods
#	searchw
#	putw
#	getw
#
# Each of the actions (search, put, get) ending with a "w" signifies
# that the action completes before the function returns.  In CA terms
# this means that a call to ca_pend_io() is issued to force the action
# to process and wait for the action to complete.  When an exception
# occurs the offending CA status return is printed using
# print ca.message(status).
