# Test CaChannel io using ca.pend_io()
#	search
#	array_put
#	array_get
#	pend_io
#
# Each group of actions (search, put, get) is executed by the call
# to pend_io().  When the actions have completed pend_io() returns
# and the code continues.  Each call to pend_io() applies to all the
# channel objects and not just the object whose method is being invoked.
# A timeout value (specified in seconds) is associated with a call to
# pend_io() if no timeout is given the default value of one second is used.
#
# Values returned from a get are stored for retrieval after pend_io()
# has returned.  The returned values are accessed using the getValue()
# method.  If pend_io() returns an error status then all values read
# during processing are not guaranteed to be correct.
